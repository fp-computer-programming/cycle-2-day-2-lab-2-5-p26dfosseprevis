#For each of the following assignment statements copy the statement as a comment, 
#then write the other way you could write the statement using augmented assignments 
#or not using augmented assignments. To start, set all variables used equal to 21.

# z **= 2

# w = w % 2

# Be sure to include comments above each pair of 2 lines with the question number (Ex. # Question 1) and print statements beneath each assignment.
